#+title: JavaScript Calculator

* User Stories
  - [ ] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers
  - [ ] I can clear the input field with a clear button
  - [ ] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I
    hit the equal button and the calculator will tell me the correct
    output.

* Notes
  - The temptation would be to use eval() for the calculation, but I'm
    leaning against it.  eval() can be dangerous, and it would be
    interesting to develop the logic for a simple 4-function
    calculator.
